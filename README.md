# Voices

## Voices 1.0
The first version of our app lets you import audio from other apps like Whatsapp or apples native voice recorder app into the app by sharing the audio with the voices app. In our app you can transcribe the audio to text. Let's say you receive a WhatsApp voice message from a friend and you want to have the text. Simply select the audio you received. Select share and then select this app to share it with. This will automatically import the audio into your voices audio gallery. Once you Enter the Voices app you will find the audio and be able to transcribe it.
